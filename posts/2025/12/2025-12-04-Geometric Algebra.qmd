Geometric algebra (aka Clifford Algebra) is a technique that turns 2d and 3d geometry into algebra. Complex numbers have a physical interpretation as bivectors. Quaternion rotation are supported through rotors in 3d dimensions and there is a physical interpretation that isn't hard to understand. Generally, it seems 

Demonstrate rotatio in 2d and 3d.
