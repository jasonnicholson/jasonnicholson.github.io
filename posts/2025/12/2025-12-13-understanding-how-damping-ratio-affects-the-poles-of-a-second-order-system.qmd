In simulation and controls, its important to understand the details of a second order system. This post is how the damping
ratio affect the poles of a second order system.

The mechanical second order system has the following form:

$$m \ddot{x} + c \dot{x} + k x = F(t)$$

Where:

- $m$ is the mass
- $c$ is the damping coefficient
- $k$ is the spring constant
- $F(t)$ is the external force applied to the system

Normalizing the equation by dividing through by $m$ gives:

$$\ddot{x} + 2 \zeta \omega_n \dot{x} + \omega_n^2 x = \frac{1}{m}F(t)$$

Where:

- $\omega_n = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}$ is the natural frequency
- $\zeta = \frac{c}{2 \sqrt{mk}}$ is the damping ratio

Taking the laplace transform with 0 initial conditions gives the transfer function. Note, that the 0 initial conditions can be handled later and that
studying the damping ratio effects on the poles is independent of initial conditions.

$$G(s) = \frac{X(s)}{F(s)} = \frac{\frac{1}{m}}{s^2 + 2 \zeta \omega_n s + \omega_n^2}$$

The poles of this system represent the roots of the denominator and can be found using the quadratic formula:

$$s = \frac{-2 \zeta \omega_n \pm \sqrt{(2 \zeta \omega_n)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot \omega_n^2}}{2 \cdot 1}$$

Let's normalize this expression by dividing through by $\omega_n$ and simplify the expression:

$$\frac{s}{\omega_n} = -\zeta \pm \sqrt{\zeta^2 - 1}$$

What's important is understanding how the damping ratio $\zeta$ affects the nature of the poles.

1. **No damping ($\zeta = 0$)**:
   - The poles are purely imaginary: $s = \pm j \omega_n$.
   - This indicates undamped oscillations at the natural frequency $\omega_n$.
2. **Underdamped ($0 < \zeta < 1$)**:
   - The poles are complex conjugates: $s = -\zeta \omega_n \pm j \omega_n \sqrt{1 - \zeta^2}$.
   - This indicates oscillatory behavior with an exponential decay determined by the real part $-\zeta \omega_n$.
3. **Critically damped ($\zeta = 1$)**:
   - The poles are real and repeated: $s = -\omega_n$.
    - This indicates the system returns to equilibrium as quickly as possible without oscillating.
4. **Overdamped ($\zeta > 1$)**:
   - The poles are real and distinct: $s = -\zeta \omega_n \pm \omega_n \sqrt{\zeta^2 - 1}$.
   - This indicates a non-oscillatory return to equilibrium, with the speed of return depending primarily on the larger of the two poles.
   - As the damping ratio goes to infinity, one pole approaches zero while the other goes to negative infinity.

Below is a plot of the poles of a second order system as a function of the damping ratio from 0 to 2. Note how when
the poles become real, one pole goes to zero while the other goes to negative infinity as the damping ratio increases.

```matlab
zeta = unique([linspace(0,1,1001), linspace(1,2,100)]).';
rootWithPositiveImaginaryPart = -zeta + sqrt(zeta.^2 -1);
rootWithNegativeImaginaryPart = -zeta - sqrt(zeta.^2 -1);
plot(rootWithPositiveImaginaryPart, 'r', 'LineWidth', 2);
hold on;
axis equal;
plot(rootWithNegativeImaginaryPart, 'b', 'LineWidth', 2);
xlabel('Real part of s/\omega_n');
ylabel('Imaginary part of s/\omega_n');
```
