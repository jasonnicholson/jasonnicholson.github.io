This note takes the @singhal2002full *homogeneous-mixture* framework and explicitly **turns off the vapor/cavitation part** (no vapor phase, no phase change). What remains is a two-constituent EVET mixture: **liquid + non-condensable gas (NCG)**.

The model is a homogeneous mixture (Equal-Velocity / Equal-Temperature; EVET) formulation:

- One mixture momentum equation (variable density)
- One scalar transport equation for non-condensable gas mass fraction
- Algebraic mixture closure for density (liquid + NCG)

## Primary variables

- $\rho$ mixture density
- $\mathbf{V}$ mixture velocity
- $f_g$ non-condensable gas mass fraction
- $\rho_g$ NCG density
- $\alpha_g$ NCG volume fraction
- $\alpha_l$ liquid volume fraction

## Mixture closure (liquid + NCG only)

With vapor ignored (set $f_v=0$ everywhere), the mixture density relation reduces to:

$$
\frac{1}{\rho}=\frac{f_g}{\rho_g}+\frac{1-f_g}{\rho_l}
$$

NCG density is computed as:

$$
\rho_g=\frac{P}{R_{air}T}
$$

The corresponding *volume fractions* follow from the same algebra used in the full model:

$$
\alpha_g=f_g\,\frac{\rho}{\rho_g}
$$

$$
\alpha_l=1-\alpha_g
$$

## NCG mass fraction transport (no phase change)

In this vapor-off limit there are **no** evaporation/condensation source terms. The transported scalar is the NCG mass fraction $f_g$:

$$
\frac{\partial}{\partial t}(\rho f_g)+\nabla\cdot(\rho\,\mathbf{V}\,f_g)=\nabla\cdot(\Gamma\,\nabla f_g)
$$

Here $\Gamma$ is an effective diffusion coefficient used for the scalar transport (typically a turbulence-model-based closure in CFD implementations).

## What this is (and is not)

- This is still an EVET *homogeneous mixture* (one velocity, one temperature, variable density).
- It is **not** a cavitation model anymore in the classic fluid-mechanics sense, because cavitation refers to the formation of **vapor-filled** cavities when local pressure falls below the liquid vapor pressure, and the associated collapse when pressure recovers (@brennen1995cavitation).

In hydraulics practice it’s common to associate cavitation damage with “air” because:

- Entrained/dissolved gas provides nuclei and strongly influences how cavities grow/collapse.
- Some phenomena are more properly called *aeration/ventilation* (gas ingestion/entrained bubbles) rather than vapor cavitation; Brennen explicitly distinguishes air entrainment (“ventilation”) from vaporization-driven cavities in the historical context of propellers (@brennen1995cavitation).

So: a liquid+air (NCG) mixture model can still be useful for predicting density/compressibility effects, but by itself it does not model vaporization/condensation.
