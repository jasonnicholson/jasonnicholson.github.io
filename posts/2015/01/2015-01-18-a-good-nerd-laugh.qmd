---

Donald Knuth wrote the program tex (pronounced tek).  He cares about code correctness and therefore gave out a reward if you ever found a bug in tex.  In 36 years, only 1289 bugs have been found.  In light of tex, Donald joking release iTeX in a 2010 presentation.  It is a joke and you have to know a little of Donald's quirks to get why the presentation is funny otherwise you may think he was serious.
