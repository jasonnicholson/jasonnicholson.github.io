Transmission Line Method (TLM) or Transmission Line Matrix method is an elegant technique used to solve lossless or lossy wave equations. Here I am gathering together resources on the topic since I have found it is not well studied in the US.

## Books

- [Christopoulos, Christos. "The transmission-line modeling (TLM) method in electromagnetics.". _Synthesis Lectures on Computational Electromagnetics_. 1.1 (2005): 1-132. ISBN: 1598290509](http://www.morganclaypool.com/doi/abs/10.2200/S00027ED1V01Y200605CEM007). This book is focused on the point of view of electrical engineering.
- [De Cogan, Donard. _Transmission line matrix (TLM) techniques for diffusion applications._ Gordon and Breach Science Publishers, 1998. ISBN: 978-9056991296](http://www.amazon.com/Transmission-Matrix-Techniques-Diffusion-Applications/dp/9056991299) 
- [De Cogan, Donard, William J. O'Connor, and Susan Pulko. _Transmission line matrix (TLM) in computational mechanics_. CRC Press, 2005. ISBN: 978-0415327176](http://www.amazon.com/Transmission-Line-Matrix-Computational-Mechanics/dp/0415327172/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1421369998&sr=8-1&keywords=De+Cogan%2C+Donard%2C+William+J.+O%27Connor%2C+and+Susan+Pulko.+Transmission+line+matrix+%28TLM%29+in+computational+mechanics.+CRC+press%2C+2005.&pebp=1421370003905&peasin=415327172) This is the book I found easiest to read from a Mechanical Engineering perspective. The book starts by looking at the wave equation in 1D. It uses the ideas of boundary conditions to explain the scattering effect that occurs in TLM. It is an easy read for an engineer who has studied the wave equation before.
