I found a profound paper written by Professor Lloyd N. Trefethen entitled [Six Myths of Polynomial Interpolation and Quadrature](https://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/trefethen/mythspaper.pdf). This paper is profound because it goes against a lot of the mainstream things that I have learned related to polynomials. After watching Professor Trefethen's [lectures](https://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/trefethen/atapvideos.html), I found that he is right and knows what he is talking about. Read the paper. It is worth your time.
